Financial market data is interesting and rich: each stock traded on the stock exchange has a price that varies every day.
The scenario is Wall Street stock data that will be used to create predictive models that, based on the daily variation in stock prices, can support and improve stock buying and selling decisions.

Data is available at https://www.kaggle.com/camnugent/sandp500/ via the file all_stocks_5yr.csv. The file contains, for each day and share of the S&P 500 (list of 500 largest American companies), the following data:

● Date - in yy-mm-dd format
● Open - Price of the share at the opening of the market on the day, in dollars.
● High - Highest price reached that day.
● Low - Lowest price reached that day.
● Close - Price of the share at the close of the market for the day.
● Volume - Number of shares sold / bought.
● Name - The name of the action.

The tool used will be the Jupyter Notebook through the pandas library.
